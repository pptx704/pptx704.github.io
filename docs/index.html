                    For the first five years of my life, I mostly stayed at my maternal grandparents at Cumilla. As my father remained in Dhaka and my mother had to attend
                    her university classes, I could not often pass quality time with my parents. But what kept me away from thinking about that was computers. Fortunately,
                    the youngest of my mom's siblings had a computer training center and I was granted a permission to access any of them at anytime; maybe because I was an
                    isolated kid in that big house of more than 50 people. I spent most of my time playing DxBall or Roadrash on a Windows XP computer. Sometimes I would
                    just draw weird demons using Paint. Whatever I did, productive or not, my love for computers began at the age of 4, or 3, I forgot.
                </div>
                <div>
                    Although I loved computers, it never occured that I am trying to make something instead of using an already available product, until it was 2018! I
                    previously learned Python and the basics of C, but never got enough motivation to build something of my own. So in 2018, I found the Harry Potter franchise
                    very intriguing. It saddened me that the Pottermore website did not allow users to duel each other anymore. So I decided to make my own HP Duelling game to play.
                    Could I make it? No, I ended up with a CLI that that let's you play text based duelling simulations with the computer. The lack of AI made it weirder. But, was
                    it worth it? Absolutely! Finally I could find the actual joy using a computer.

                    Fast forward to 2021, I am studying CS at a specialized CS research institute in Russia. Let's see what comes next!

                                    In 2021, I was assigned to make a website for Notre Dame English Club. So accompanied by a <a href="https://github.com/binarysakir">friend</a>, 
                                    I had built this dynamic webapp. My task was to build the backend and database models whilst my friend completed most of the frontend works.
                                    Later the dev-ops was done by me.

                                    The site backend is made with Django and MongoDB has been used for DbMS using the Djongo ORM. Bootsrap has been mainly used for
                                    frontend with a pinch of JQuery, OWL, and AOS as well as plain CSS and JS. The site is hosted on an Amazon Lightsail instance using Apache
                                    and WSGI.

                                    For some official works at Notre Dame English Club, I had to send loads of personalized emails very often. So I thought it would be
                                    a good idea to make a Python application that allows its users to send emails in bulk. And so I made it! It supports personalizing 
                                    emails based on different field from a database.

                                    other SMTP Servers and has a better GUI. I am thinking of making it a webserver based application to make it more dynamic with flexible GUI.
